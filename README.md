## Unit 1 - Introduction to Git

### Lesson 1 - Welcome

#### 💡 - Main ideas

- Here is a quick overview of what we will learn:
* Git basics
* viewing the change history
* creating and merging branches
* working with remote repositories
* creating merge requests
* resolving conflicts

### Lesson 2 - Prerequisites

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- you need to have Git installed on your computer
- check if Git is installed by using this command: `git --version`

#### 📚 - Resources

* [Git installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

* basic commands

### Lesson 3 - Creating a Git repository

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- a repository is a place that stores something
- a Git repository stores files and keeps track of any changes
- we want to be able to keep track of all changes, to see who has made them and, if needed, have the possibility to revert to a previous version
- to create a new Git repository run this command inside an empty folder:
```
mkdir my-cool-website
cd my-cool-website
git init
```
- `git init` has created a hidden folder called `.git` which stores the repository
- use `git status` to check the current status of the repository

### Lesson 4 - Configuring Git

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- to identify who has made a specific change, we need to configure our name and email

```
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
```

- this will help anyone to look at the changes in the repository see who has made them

### Lesson 5 - Your first Git commit

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- a commit is a snapshot of the repository at a point in time
- steps to create a commit:
* create a new file index.html with content:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Vega IT Git Workshop</h2>
</body>
</html>
```
* check status by runing `git status`
* stage the file by running `git add <FILE NAME>`
* commit the file by running `git commit -m "Init"`

### Lesson 6 - Git staging explained
![git-add.png](..%2F..%2FPictures%2FScreenshots%2Fgit-add.png)
#### 💡 - Main ideas
- the staging process allows us to select which files we want to commit (to group commits)
- to add all changes to a commit you can use `git add .` or `git add --all`

### Lesson 7 - Unstaging changes

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- if you wish to unstage a file, you can use the command:
```
git reset HEAD <FILE>
```

### Lesson 8 - Viewing changes with git log

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- use the `git log` command to view a list of changes
- use `git log --patch` for a more detailed history

### Lesson 9 - Committing a folder

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- you cannot commit an empty folder with Git
- to have a folder tracked by Git, add an emtpy file called `.gitkeep`
- `.gitkeep` is just a convention, not a rule.

### Lesson 10 - Deleting files

#### 💡 - Main ideas

- to delete a file it depends if it is tracked or untracked
- to delete a file tracked by Git, you need to remove it from the file system and commit this change

### Lesson 11 - The .gitignore file

#### 💡 - Main ideas

- not all files need to be stored in Git but need to be part of the folder used with Git
- example for a `.gitignore` file:
```

```
- this works only for files that have not been committed already

### Lesson 12 - Creating a branch

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- branching helps you divert from the main development work
- branches are often prefixed with `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix` etc.
- create a new branch with: `git checkout -b <BRANCH NAME>` or `git switch -C <BRANCH NAME>`
- to switch back to master/main run: `git checkout master`

### Lesson 13 - Merging a branch (fast forward)

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- you have to be inside the branch where you want to have the result of the merge (typically the master/main branch)
- the command you use is `git merge <BRANCH YOU WISH TO MERGE>`
- verify the command output says "fast-forward merge"
- use `git log` to view the commits added

### Lesson 14 - Merging a branch (recursive)

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- if you continue making changes in the master branch after the point in time the branch is created, a fast-forward merge is no longer possible.
- git merge will try to merge the branches even if they have different parents

### Lesson 15 - Rebasing commits

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- we often try to avoid merge commits to keep the history clean
- you run rebase on the branch you want to sync with the master/main branch
- `git rebase master`

### Lesson 16 - Resolving merge conflicts

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- merge conflicts are one of the most annoying things in Git
- they are a normal occurrence but they still cause a lot of frustration.
- you can abort a merge: `git merge --abort`
- you can get a merge conflict when rebasing as well
- I recommend resolving conflicts in VSC or other IDEs.

### Lesson 17 - Working with remote repositories

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- Git is a distributed versioning system
- We can have local repositories, but we can also have remote repositories
- we often use remote repositories like GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket to collaborate with others the project, to share changes
- you need a Github.com account which is free to create
- create new repo
- origin <- alias for the remote repository
- setup ssh key

#### 📚 - Resources

* [Setup SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

### Lesson 18 - Pushing changes to a remote repository

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- commits are not automatically sent to the remote repository
- to push changes use `git push`
- example for pushing the master branch: `git push origin master`


### Lesson 21 - Pulling changes from a remote repository

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- you can pull changes with `git pull`
- example: `git pull origin master`
- use `git pull --rebase` to rebase any unpushed commits
- pull and rebase often to avoid merge conflicts
- short-lived branches work best and reduce complexity, keep them as small as possible

### Lesson 22 - Resolving conflicts with remote repositories

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- if the remote repository contains changes you don't have you cannot push any commits
- pulling changes may conflict with your own commits (similar to merging a branch)

### Lesson 23 - Rebasing while pulling changes

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- use `git pull --rebase` to rebase local changes with remote changes
- example: `git pull origin master --rebase`


### Lesson 24 - Cloning a remote repository

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- cloning refers to the action o creating an exact copy of an existing Git repository
- the command is: `git clone <REPOSITORY LOCATION>`

### Lesson 25 - Working with merge requests

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- a merge request is a way to review and integrate changes into the master branch

### Lesson 26 - Conclusion

#### 💡 - Main ideas
- spend more time practicing the concepts demonstrated until you get used to them
